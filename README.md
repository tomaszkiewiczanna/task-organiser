# task organiser
The aim of the project was to practice JS by writting a simple task organizer with RWD layout.
User can define task's name, the date up to which the task should be done and a priority of that. As an output he gets list of info notes with a color box. Colors of the box mirror the priority, as they go from green to red.
User can mark the task if it's finished and remove all of them or specified one.
